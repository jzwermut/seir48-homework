## Warmup - Simon Says

Create a function that takes an input and returns Simon's response as follows:
- Simon answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.
- He answers 'Woah, chill out!' if you yell at him (ALL CAPS).
- He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying anything.
- He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.
