// ## Recurring Letters

// Create a function that takes in a sentence and outputs the letter that's repeated most frequently.

// ```js
// recurringLetter('just a simple sentence chilling');
// // => The recurring letter of "just a simple sentence chilling" is e
// ```

// Use simple sentences with regular spaces between each word (like in the sentence you are reading) but if you want you can account for other characters such as !@#$%^&*? etc..

// *Hint:* You'll need to loop and count each of the letters.

// **Bonus:** Create another function that capitalises a letter within the sentence. 
// ```js
// capitaliseLetter('just a simple sentence chilling', 'e');
// // => just a simplE sEntEncE chilling

const recurring = (str) => {
   const stringObject = _(str).countBy();
   console.log(stringObject)
}
