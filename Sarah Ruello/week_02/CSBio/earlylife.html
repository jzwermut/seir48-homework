                Holberton was born Frances Elizabeth Snyder in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1917. Her father was John Amos Snyder (1884-1963), her mother was Frances J. Morrow (1892-1981) and she was born as the third child in a family of 8 children.

                Holberton studied journalism, because its curriculum let her travel far afield. Journalism was also one of the few fields open to women as a career in the 1940s. On her first day of classes at the University of Pennsylvania, Holberton's math professor
                asked her if she wouldn't be better off at home raising children.

                She also participated in the development of early standards for the COBOL and FORTRAN programming languages with Grace Hopper. Later, as an employee of the National Bureau of Standards, she was very active in the first two revisions of the Fortran language
                standard ("FORTRAN 77" and "Fortran 90").
