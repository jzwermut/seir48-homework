        <h2>Why Joel admires him</h2>
        <p>
        <b>I suppose Joel admires him for his unwavering defience in the face of adversity.</b><br>
         The punishment for homosexuality was chemical castration, a series of hormone injections that left Turing impotent. It also caused gynecomastia, giving him breasts. But Turing refused to let the treatment sway him from his work, keeping up his lively spirit.

        <p>
            <b>He helped beat Nazis.</b><br>
             I'm going to guess that Joel is apposed to Nazis.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>He push forwards computer.</b><br>
            Some consider him the father of modern computer science, and was famous for his work developing the first modern computers.
