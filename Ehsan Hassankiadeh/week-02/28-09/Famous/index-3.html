          Norbert Wiener (November 26, 1894 – March 18, 1964) was an American
          mathematician and philosopher. He was a professor of mathematics at
          the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). A child prodigy,
          Wiener later became an early researcher in stochastic and mathematical
          noise processes, contributing work relevant to electronic engineering,
          electronic communication, and control systems. Wiener is considered
          the originator of cybernetics, the science of communication as it
          relates to living things and machines,[3] with implications for
          engineering, systems control, computer science, biology, neuroscience,
          philosophy, and the organization of society. Norbert Wiener is
          credited as being one of the first to theorize that all intelligent
          behavior was the result of feedback mechanisms, that could possibly be
          simulated by machines and was an important early step towards the
          development of modern artificial intelligence.[4]

          Wiener was born in Columbia, Missouri, the first child of Leo Wiener
          and Bertha Kahn, Jewish immigrants from Poland and Germany,
          respectively. Through his father, he was related to Maimonides, the
          famous rabbi, philosopher and physician from Al Andalus, as well as to
          Akiva Eger, chief rabbi of Posen from 1815 to 1837.[5] Leo had
          educated Norbert at home until 1903, employing teaching methods of his
          own invention, except for a brief interlude when Norbert was 7 years
          of age. Earning his living teaching German and Slavic languages, Leo
          read widely and accumulated a personal library from which the young
          Norbert benefited greatly. Leo also had ample ability in mathematics
          and tutored his son in the subject until he left home. In his
          autobiography, Norbert described his father as calm and patient,
          unless he (Norbert) failed to give a correct answer, at which his
          father would lose his temper.

          The next year he returned to Harvard, while still continuing his
          philosophical studies. Back at Harvard, Wiener became influenced by
          Edward Vermilye Huntington, whose mathematical interests ranged from
          axiomatic foundations to engineering problems. Harvard awarded Wiener
          a Ph.D. in June 1913, when he was only 19 years old, for a
          dissertation on mathematical logic (a comparison of the work of Ernst
          Schröder with that of Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell),
          supervised by Karl Schmidt, the essential results of which were
          published as Wiener (1914). He was one of the youngest to achieve such
          a feat. In that dissertation, he was the first to state publicly that
          ordered pairs can be defined in terms of elementary set theory. Hence
          relations can be defined by set theory, thus the theory of relations
          does not require any axioms or primitive notions distinct from those
          of set theory. In 1921, Kazimierz Kuratowski proposed a simplification
          of Wiener's definition of ordered pairs, and that simplification has
          been in common use ever since. It is (x, y) = {{x}, {x, y}}.

          Although Wiener eventually became a staunch pacifist, he eagerly
          contributed to the war effort in World War I. In 1916, with America's
          entry into the war drawing closer, Wiener attended a training camp for
          potential military officers but failed to earn a commission. One year
          later Wiener again tried to join the military, but the government
          again rejected him due to his poor eyesight. In the summer of 1918,
          Oswald Veblen invited Wiener to work on ballistics at the Aberdeen
          Proving Ground in Maryland.[7] Living and working with other
          mathematicians strengthened his interest in mathematics. However,
          Wiener was still eager to serve in uniform and decided to make one
          more attempt to enlist, this time as a common soldier. Wiener wrote in
          a letter to his parents, "I should consider myself a pretty cheap kind
          of a swine if I were willing to be an officer but unwilling to be a
          soldier."[8] This time the army accepted Wiener into its ranks and
          assigned him, by coincidence, to a unit stationed at Aberdeen,
          Maryland. World War I ended just days after Wiener's return to
          Aberdeen and Wiener was discharged from the military in February
          1919.[9]
