        <h1>Von Neumann Trivia</h1>

      <article class='trivia'>
        <p>Von Neumann believed that much of his mathematical thought occurred intuitively; he would often go to sleep with a problem unsolved and know the answer upon waking up.</p>
        <p>Von Neumann liked to eat and drink; his wife, Klara, said that he could count everything except calories. </p>
        <p>Von Neumann held a lifelong passion for ancient history and was renowned for his historical knowledge. A professor of Byzantine history at Princeton once said that von Neumann had greater expertise in Byzantine history than he did.</p>
        <p>He always wore formal suits. He once wore a three-piece pinstripe while riding down the Grand Canyon astride a mule.</p>
        <p>Von Neumann created the field of cellular automata without the aid of computers, constructing the first self-replicating automata with pencil and graph paper, essentially coming up with the concept of modern day biochemistry. Even before the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953.</p>
        <p>Despite being a notoriously bad driver, he enjoyed drivingâ€”frequently while reading a book, resulting in numerous arrests as well as accidents. When Cuthbert Hurd hired him as a consultant to IBM, Hurd often quietly paid the fines for his traffic tickets.</p>
