      <p class="p2"> In 1981, Sophie extended Acorn’s home computer BASIC programming language.
        A more advanced microcomputer that ensued won the company a contract with the BBC and spawned the BBC Micro,
        for which the BBC BASIC programming language was developed. Sophie then designed the instruction set for the ARM microprocessor,
         which later became one of the most successful licenced computer cores. Sophie designed the VLIW FirePath processor architecture and
         was part of a start-up to exploit the processor, which was subsequently bought by US ‘fabless’ semiconductor company Broadcom.
         Sophie is now Senior Technical Director for Broadcom where she is still developing FirePath. She was elected a Fellow of the
          Computer History Museum in Silicon Valley in 2012.</p>
