                <h1>Alan Turing's Biography</h1>
                <img src="css/img/alan.jpg">
                <p>Alan Mathison Turing ( 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician,
                    computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was
                    highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of
                    the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model
                    of a
                    general-purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer
                    science and artificial intelligence.</p>

            <h1>Accomplishments</h1>
            <p>
                He graduated at King's College, Cambridge, with a degree in mathematics. Whilst he was a fellow at
                Cambridge, he published a proof demonstrating that some purely mathematical yes–no questions can never
                be answered by computation and defined a Turing machine, and went on to prove the halting problem for
                Turing machines is undecidable. In 1938, he obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at
                Princeton University. During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher
                School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a
                time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a
                number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war
                Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine.
                Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat
                the Axis powers in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic
                Computing Engine (ACE), one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined
                Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory, at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped
                develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on
                the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the
                Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s. Despite these accomplishments, he was never
                fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime because much of his work was covered by the
                Official Secrets Act.
            </p>

                Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts. He accepted chemical castration treatment, with DES,
                as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide
                poisoning. An inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence
                is also consistent with accidental poisoning.

            <p>
                In 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public
                apology on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he was treated". Queen Elizabeth II
                granted Turing a posthumous pardon in 2013. The "Alan Turing law" is now an informal term for a 2017 law
                in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical
                legislation that outlawed homosexual acts. Turing has an extensive legacy with statues of him and
                many things named after him, including an annual award for computer science innovations. He appears on
                the current Bank of England £50 note, which was released to coincide with his birthday. A 2019 BBC
                series, as voted by the audience, named him the greatest person of the 20th century.
