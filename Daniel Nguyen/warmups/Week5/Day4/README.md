# Grammar

“I before E except after C” is perhaps the most famous English spelling rule. For the purpose of this challenge, the rule says: if “ei” appears in a word, it must immediately follow “c”. If “ie” appears in a word, it must not immediately follow “c”.

A word also follows the rule if neither “ei” nor “ie” appears anywhere in the word. Examples of words that follow this rule are:

> fiery hierarchy hieroglyphic ceiling inconceivable kendone daily drummachine one two three

Write a function that tells you whether or not a given word follows the “I before E except after C” rule.

## Bonus - allow the function to return true if the word matches any of the following words also
