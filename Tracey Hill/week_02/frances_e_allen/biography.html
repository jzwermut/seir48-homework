          <h1>Frances 'Fran' Allen</h1>
          <h2>Biography - A life-long career with IBM</h2>
          <p>
            Inspired by her math teacher Allen, followed the path of many women
            her generation did and became a teacher. After two years of
            teaching, Fran went back to study and took a handful of basic
            computing classes, she learned that IBM was interviewing potential
            candidates on campus and signed up for an interview. When offered a
            position, she envisioned herself working for IBM for just a year,
            mainly to help pay off her loans from her Master’s degree program
            and planned to return to teaching—a job that she loved. Fran's first
            day at IBM Research was on July 15, 1957, just three months prior to
            IBM’s introduction of FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation), the first
            high-level programming language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given Fran’s background in teaching and the need to rapidly train
            Research division scientists in this new, rather complex language,
            Fran’s first job at IBM was to teach FORTRAN. Although she initially
            planned to return to teaching after paying off her student loans,
            Fran ultimately remained at IBM for the duration of her career.
