# Pig Latin
Create a function that will translate your input to Pig Latin!
Move the first letter of each word to the end of it, then add "ay" to the end of the word.
Leave punctuation marks untouched (it's fine to keep the space between punctuation marks and the word). Not case sensitive.
E.g. if your input = "Pig Latin is cool !", your output should look like => "igPay atinLay siay oolcay !"
