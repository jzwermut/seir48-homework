                Most people were not actually aware of the full extent of Turings contributions to the world. As his
                work on the Enigma machine was classified until the 1970s. Even then, the techniques he used to decipher
                the Enimga machine weren't released till 2013.

                He created the Turing test in order to measure artificial intelligence. His paper "Computing Machinery
                and Intelligence" arguing that a machines ability to "think" was not a useful measure of intelligence.
                But rather, their artificial intelligence can be better assessed through the "imitation game". Where a
                computer is tested, based on whether or not they can convince a person that it is human
