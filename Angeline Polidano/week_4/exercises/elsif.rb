# # Exercises: if/else statements
#
# ## What number's bigger?
#
# Write a function named greaterNum that:
# - takes 2 arguments, both numbers.
# - returns whichever number is the greater (higher) number.
# - Call that function 2 times with different number pairs, and log the output to make sure it works (e.g. "The greater number of 5 and 10 is 10.").

def greater_num

  a = 17
  b = 23


if "a" > "b"
  puts "a"
elsif "b" > "a"
  puts "b"
