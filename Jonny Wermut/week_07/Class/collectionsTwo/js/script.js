// ## Exercises

// - Sort the ` people ` by 'uid'
// - Group the random words by the lower case version of their first letter
// - Check to see if all the words have more than 3 characters
// - Check if some words are over twenty characters long
// - Get an array of all of the uids in ` people `
// - Find the person with the highest uid
// - Return an object that says how many even numbers and how many odd numbers there are in ` numbers `
// - Get three random numbers out of ` numbers `

// ## Remember!

// You have the [documentation!](https://underscorejs.org/)
