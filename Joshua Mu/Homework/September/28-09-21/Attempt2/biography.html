                    Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS was an English mathematician,
                    computer
                    scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly
                    influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the
                    concepts of
                    algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a
                    general-purpose
                    computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and
                    artificial intelligence.

                    Born in Maida Vale, London, Turing was raised in southern England. He graduated at King's College,
                    Cambridge, with a degree in mathematics. Whilst he was a fellow at Cambridge, he published a proof
                    demonstrating that some purely mathematical yes–no questions can never be answered by computation
                    and
                    defined a Turing machine, and went on to prove the halting problem for Turing machines is
                    undecidable.
                    In
                    1938, he obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University. During the
                    Second
                    World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park,
                    Britain's
                    codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was
                    responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the
                    breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an
                    electromechanical
                    machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a crucial role in cracking
                    intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Axis powers in many crucial
                    engagements,
                    including the Battle of the Atlantic.

                    After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic
                    Computing
                    Engine (ACE), one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined Max
                    Newman's
                    Computing Machine Laboratory, at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the
                    Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the
                    chemical
                    basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the
                    Belousov–Zhabotinsky
                    reaction, first observed in the 1960s. Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognised
                    in
                    his
                    home country during his lifetime because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets
                    Act.

                    Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts. He accepted chemical castration treatment, with
                    DES,
                    as
                    an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide
                    poisoning.
                    An
                    inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also
                    consistent
                    with accidental poisoning.

                    In 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public
                    apology
                    on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he was treated". Queen Elizabeth II
                    granted
                    Turing a posthumous pardon in 2013. The "Alan Turing law" is now an informal term for a 2017 law in
                    the
                    United Kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation
                    that
                    outlawed homosexual acts. Turing has an extensive legacy with statues of him and many things
                    named
                    after
                    him, including an annual award for computer science innovations. He appears on the current Bank of
                    England
                    £50 note, which was released to coincide with his birthday. A 2019 BBC series, as voted by the
                    audience,
                    named him the greatest person of the 20th century.

                    Hmmm.... not sure what to put here, since Joel probably knows most of Alan Turings general biography
                    :(
