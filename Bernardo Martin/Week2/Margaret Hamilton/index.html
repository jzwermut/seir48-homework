      <h2> Margaret looking cute - 1986 </h2>
      <p> Margaret Hamilton, née Margaret Heafield, (born August 17, 1936, Paoli,
          Indiana, U.S.), American computer scientist who was one of the first computer
          software programmers; she created the term software engineer to describe her work.
          She helped write the computer code for the command and lunar modules used
          on the Apollo missions to the Moon in the late 1960s and early ’70s.

      <p class="second-paragraph">While studying mathematics and philosophy at Earlham College in Richmond,
         Indiana, she met James Hamilton, and they subsequently married. After
         graduating in 1958, she taught high-school mathematics for a short time.
         The couple then moved to Boston. Although Margaret planned to study abstract
         mathematics at Brandeis University, she accepted a job at the Massachusetts
         Institute of Technology (MIT) while her husband attended Harvard Law School.
         At MIT she began programming software to predict the weather and did postgraduate
         work in meteorology.
