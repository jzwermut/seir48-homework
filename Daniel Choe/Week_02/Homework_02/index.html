- At least 1 Google Font
- Whatever HTML and CSS you desire
- Keep your code clean and DRY
- Start working with semantic elements: http://html5doctor.com/lets-talk-about-semantics/
- No Javascript! Even if you know how to use jQuery, see how far you can push this with pure HTML + CSS
- Don't worry about responsiveness -- desktop resolution is fine

      <h3>Early Life & Education</h3>
      <p>
        Grace Brewster Murray was born in New York City. She was the eldest of three children.
        Her parents, Walter Fletcher Murray and Mary Campbell Van Horne, were of Scottish and Dutch
        descent, and attended West End Collegiate Church. Her great-grandfather, Alexander Wilson
        Russell, an admiral in the US Navy, fought in the Battle of Mobile Bay during the Civil War.
        Grace was very curious as a child; this was a lifelong trait. At the age of seven, she decided
        to determine how an alarm clock worked and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother
        realized what she was doing (she was then limited to one clock). For her preparatory school
        education, she attended the Hartridge School in Plainfield, New Jersey. Grace was initially
        rejected for early admission to Vassar College at age 16 (because her test scores in Latin
        were too low), but she was admitted the following year. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from
        Vassar in 1928 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics and earned her master's
        degree at Yale University in 1930. In 1930 Grace Murray married New York University
        professor Vincent Foster Hopper (1906–1976); they divorced in 1945. Although she did
        not marry again, she retained his surname. In 1934, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics
        from Yale under the direction of Øystein Ore. Her dissertation, "New Types of Irreducibility
        Criteria", was published that same year. She began teaching mathematics at Vassar in 1931,
        and was promoted to associate professor in 1941.

    <h3>Her Career</h3>
      <p>
        Hopper had tried to enlist in the Navy early in World War II. She was rejected for a few reasons.
        At age 34, she was too old to enlist, and her weight to height ratio was too low.
        She was also denied on the basis that her job as a mathematician and mathematics professor
        at Vassar College was valuable to the war effort.  During the war in 1943, Hopper obtained
        a leave of absence from Vassar and was sworn into the United States Navy Reserve; she was one
        of many women who volunteered to serve in the WAVES. She had to get an exemption to enlist;
        she was 15 pounds (6.8 kg) below the Navy minimum weight of 120 pounds (54 kg). She reported
        in December and trained at the Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School at Smith College in Northampton,
        Massachusetts.

      <p>
        Hopper graduated first in her class in 1944, and was assigned to the
        Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University as a lieutenant, junior grade.
        She served on the Mark I computer programming staff headed by Howard H. Aiken. Hopper and
        Aiken co-authored three papers on the Mark I, also known as the Automatic Sequence
        Controlled Calculator. Hopper's request to transfer to the regular Navy at the end of the
        war was declined due to her advanced age of 38. She continued to serve in the Navy Reserve.
        Hopper remained at the Harvard Computation Lab until 1949, turning down a full professorship
        at Vassar in favor of working as a research fellow under a Navy contract at Harvard.
