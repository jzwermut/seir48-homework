// ## Part 1
//  //  Write a function called squareNumber that will take one argument (a number), square that number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."

const squareNumber = function(num){

const squareresult = (num * num)
  console.log(squareresult + "The  result of sqaring the number")

}

squareNumber(6)
squareNumber(3)
// - Write a function called halfNumber that will take one argument (a number), divide it by 2, and return the result. It should also log a string like "Half of 5 is 2.5.".
const halfnumber = function(num){

const halfnumber = (5 / 2)
console.log(halfnumber + "Half of five is 2.5,")

}
halfnumber(2.5)

// - Write a function called percentOf that will take two numbers, figure out what percent the first number represents of the second number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "2 is 50% of 4."
const percentOf = function(num , num){
const percentOf(num1 / num2)
console.log(2 is 50% Of 4)
return the result
}
// - Write a function called areaOfCircle that will take one argument (the radius), calculate the area based on that, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The area for a circle with radius 2 is 12.566370614359172."

const radius = 1;
const area = 2 * radius * math . pow 12
console.log(the area for a circle is 2 of 12.566370614359172)
}
return the result
// - Bonus: Round the result so there are only two digits after the decimal.
//
// ## Part 2
// Write a function that will take one argument (a number) and perform the following operations, using the functions you wrote earlier1:
const calculator = function(num){
const result 1 = halfnumber(num)
result 2 = squareNumber
result 3 = areaforcircle
result 4 = percentof
}
// - Take half of the number and store the result.
// - Square the result of #1 and store that result.
// - Calculate the area of a circle with the result of #2 as the radius.
// - Calculate what percentage that area is of the squared result (#3).
