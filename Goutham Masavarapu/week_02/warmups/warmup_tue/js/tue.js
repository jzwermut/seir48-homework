// # Sum of arrays
// Write a function that receives two arguments, both of which are Arrays
// and sums them. These arrays contain only numbers. You don't know
// their length and they can contain both integers and floating point numbers.
//
// ## Example
// ```
//   [2, 6.4, 3] + [3, 3.6, 2] = 20
// ```
//
// # Bonus
// Create another version of the above function that can accept more
// than two arrays as the arguments (you don't know the specific number of arguments). Hint - look up 'The arguments object'.
//
// # Bonus bonus
// Create another version of the above function that can accept
// numbers, arrays or a combination of the two for any amount of arguments.
