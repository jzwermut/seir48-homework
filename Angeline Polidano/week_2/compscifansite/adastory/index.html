   In 1847, at the tender age of 27, Ada Lovelace became the world’s first programmer, more than a hundred years before the first computer was actually introduced. Ahead of her time is likely an understatement, and of course there’s much to learn from Lovelace’s story. Today, scientists all over the world celebrate her legacy by holding special events that seek to encourage women to pursue careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). While gender discrepancy in STEM has somewhat leveled out, far too few women embark on this sort of career path. One can only imagine how society must have looked upon the likes of Lovelace, a full blown mathematical genius in the XIXth century, who was prolific decades before Marie Curie – perhaps the most cited science female role model – was even born. Alas, she was ‘but’ a woman.

   A genius ahead of her time
   The daughter of none other than Lord Byron, the famous poet, Lovelace become acquainted while she was only 18 to inventor Charles Babbage, then 42. The two strung a close friendship that would change Ada’s life forever. Babbage was working on a very early, calculator-like computer called The Difference Engine, which eventually went to grow into the Analytical Engine, a forerunner to the modern computer. In 1842, Ada translated a description of it by Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea. “As she understood [it] so well”, Babbage asked Ada to expand the article, which eventually grew into a 20,000-word work that included the first computer program: An algorithm that would teach the machine how to calculate a series of Bernoulli Numbers.

   “By understanding what the Analytical Engine could do — that it was far more than just a calculator — there’s no doubt whatsoever that Ada glimpsed the future of information technology,” said James Essinger, whose biography of Lovelace titled Ada’s Algorithm is published this week. According to Essinger, Ada expanded on Babbage’s ideas and envisioned the modern day computer. “What computers do, with literally billions of applications by billions of people, is exactly what Ada foresaw. In some ways, it is almost miraculously prophetic.”

   Unfortunately, Babbage never created the machine and Ada was unable to test her theory before she died at the age of 36 of cancer.
