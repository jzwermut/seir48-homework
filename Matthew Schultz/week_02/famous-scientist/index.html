      <p>This page is dedicated to the American mathmatician, electrical engineer and cryptographer. Shannon founded information theory with a landmark paper, "A Mathematical Theory of Communication", which he published in 1948. </p>
      <p>He also founded digital circuit design theory in 1937, when—as a 21-year-old master's degree student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)—he wrote his thesis demonstrating that electrical applications of Boolean algebra could construct any logical numerical relationship.[3] Shannon contributed to the field of cryptanalysis for national defense during World War II, including his fundamental work on codebreaking and secure telecommunications.</p>

        <p>Thomas Edison was Shannon's hero and a huge influence on his work. He later discovered that they were distant cousins!</p>
