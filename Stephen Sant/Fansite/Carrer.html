        <p><b>Cryptanalysis</b><br>
            During the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers.
            He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma cipher machine used by Nazi Germany. In July 1939, the Polish Cipher Bureau gave the British and French details of the wiring of Enigma machine's rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma machine's messages.
            The method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the Germans were likely to change, which they did in May 1940. Turing's approach was more general, using crib-based decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe.
            <br>TLDR: He decrypted Nazi secrets.
        </p>
        <p><b>The Bombe</b><br>      
            Turing had specified an electromechanical machine called the bombe, which could break Enigma more effectively than the Polish bomba kryptologiczna.
            For each possible setting of the rotors (which had on the order of 10 to the 19th states, or 10 to the 22nd states for the four-rotor U-boat variant), the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the 'crib'(the plaintext), implemented electromechanically.
            <br>TLDR: He made a machine to decrypt Nazi secrets.

        <p><b>Early computers</b> <br>
            In February 19 1946 he lived in Hampton, London where he presented a paper, which was the first detailed design of a stored-program computer.
            Although it was a feasible design, the effect of the Official Secrets Act surrounding the wartime work made it impossible for Turing to explain how a computer installation involving human operators would work. This led to delays in starting the project.
            In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge when the Pilot ACE was being built in his absence. It executed its first program on 10 May 1950, and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it, including the English Electric DEUCE and the American Bendix G-15. The full version of Turing's ACE was not built until after his death.
            <br>TLDR: He design the first programmable computers.

        <p><b>Pattern formation and mathematical biology</b><br>
            Turing was interested in morphogenesis, the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms.
            In 1951, he turned to mathematical biology and in 1952 he published "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis".
            He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space, termed a reaction–diffusion system, could account for "the main phenomena of morphogenesis". 
            To calculate this, Turing would have needed a powerful computer, but these were not so freely available in 1951, so he had to use linear approximations to solve the equations by hand.
            <br>TLDR: The madlad solved flowers on paper.

        <p><b>The future of computers</b><br>
            After the war, Turing continued to develop his ideas about computer science. His work led to the construction of the first true computers, but his most famous work came in 1950 when he published a paper asking “can machines think?”.
            He detailed a procedure, later known as the Turing test, to determine whether a machine could imitate human conversation. It became a foundational part of the field of artificial intelligence.
            <br>TLDR: You've heard of the Turing Test right?
