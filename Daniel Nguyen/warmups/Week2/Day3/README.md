# Beach Days

Write a program that, given a minimum temperature and a maximum rainfall forecast, output a list of days you can go to the beach.

## Example:
with the following forecast:

- Monday: the temperature is 20 and there is 12mm of rain
- Tuesday: the temperature is 25 and there is 6mm of rain
- Wednesday: the temperature is 27 and there is 24mm of rain
- Thursday: the temperature is 32 and there is 65mm of rain
- Friday: the temperature is 18 and there is 2mm of rain
- Saturday: the temperature is 26 and there is 0mm of rain
- Sunday: the temperature is 27 and there is 14mm of rain

If it's ok to go to the beach with a temperature at least 24 degrees and no more than 8mm of rain, the output of the program should be: Tuesday and Saturday

## Hint:
Find a way to store your data (array, object, ...)
