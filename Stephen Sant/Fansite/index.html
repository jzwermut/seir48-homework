        <p class="biography">    
        <b>Full name:</b> Alan Mathison Turing <br>
        <b>Birth:</b> 23 June 1912, Maida Vale, London<br>
        <b>Death:</b> 7 June 1954, Wilmslow, Cheshire<br>

        Alan Mathison Turing, born 23 June 1912, was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician and cryptanalyst.
        Turing was raised in southern England. He graduated at King's College, Cambridge, with a degree in mathematics.
        In 1938, he obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University. During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. 
        For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers.
        After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine, one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory, at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. 
        He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousovâ€“Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s. 
        Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.
        Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts. He accepted chemical castration treatment, with DES, as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning.
        There is some debate whether his death was suicide or an accidental poisoning.
